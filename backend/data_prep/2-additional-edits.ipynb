    "It is clear from tests that the final csv file used to generate the json for multi-character words has a few errors. Many words lack pronunciations, and some lack valid definitions (only containing pinyin without context). We use a google translate API to fix some. First, we replace all pronunciations using google translate. Then, we check for syllables with accent marks in the definitions, and find definitions using the same API for definitions with only pinyin (no real meaning given)"
